      <h2>Why We need To Learn Coding?</h2>
      One of the best things about coding is that anyone can learn how to do it. No matter your age, gender, or background, coding is a skill that anyone can pick up.

For a long time, people viewed coding as a skill for math and science geniuses. But that is no longer the case. While it helps to be good at math and have an analytical mindset, you donâ€™t need to be a genius to learn to code. As long as you are willing to put in the time and effort, anyone can learn to code.
